# Web-Exploitation

Web-Exploitation for me personaly is the heart of the internet because it all starts and ends from the Web. 

It's a vast majority of resources to understand how to exploit vulnerabilities on the web. I am focusing this in three sections: Learning Resources, Challenges that enforce the understanding, and some common tools

## Learning Resources 

- How does the Web Work? 

    TCP/IP Model

    OSI Model

    Probably not dive deep into networking but having a decent understand of the networking will help here

- What Front-End & Back-End Truly is?

- Apache and etc

- How does SSL/TLS Cert work?
    - 1) User Creates his own Certificate Authority (rootCA and CA private key)
    - 2) Generate Server Private Key
    - 3) Use Server Private Key to Create CSR (Certificate Signing Request) with required info
    - 4) Use CSR and CA certs to generate SSL
    - 5) Use self signed certificate with the application
    - 6) Install user rootCA in browser or OS

- [HTTPS, SSL, TLS & CA Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnY6fSng3Ew&t=2014s) This is a god tier explanation of how HTTPS works and why we need certificates

- A guide on [SSRF](https://www.intigriti.com/researchers/blog/hacking-tools/ssrf-a-complete-guide-to-exploiting-advanced-ssrf-vulnerabilities#5-exploiting-second-order-ssrfs)

## Challenges

These labs are technically resources too but these are definitely the challenges you want to do to enforce that understanding of the web 

- [PenTester Lab](https://pentesterlab.com/) Learn by exploiting real-world CVEs and analyzing vulnerabilities at the code level.

- PortSwigger Academy

- OWASP Juice Shop

- Some THM Web based free rooms that I could add

- [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/practice) I practiced a ton of Web Exp here but there's other categories as well!

## Tools

- SQLMap for SQL Injections

- Gobuster etc

- API stuff

- Postman stuff here

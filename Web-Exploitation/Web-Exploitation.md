# Web-Exploitation

Web-Exploitation for me personaly is the heart of the internet because it all starts and ends from the Web. 

It's a vast majority of resources to understand how to exploit vulnerabilities on the web. I am focusing this in three sections: Learning Resources, Challenges that enforce the understanding, and some common tools

## Learning Resources 

- How does the Web Work? 

    TCP/IP Model

    OSI Model

    Probably not dive deep into networking but having a decent understand of the networking will help here

- What Front-End & Back-End Truly is?

- Apache and etc
- [Networking Tutorial Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypH19whXTVoG3oKSuOcw_XeW) A great playlist to get information and cover a lot of information on what you need to know about networks as you get started

- How does SSL/TLS Cert work?
    - 1) User Creates his own Certificate Authority (rootCA and CA private key)
    - 2) Generate Server Private Key
    - 3) Use Server Private Key to Create CSR (Certificate Signing Request) with required info
    - 4) Use CSR and CA certs to generate SSL
    - 5) Use self signed certificate with the application
    - 6) Install user rootCA in browser or OS

- [HTTPS, SSL, TLS & CA Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnY6fSng3Ew&t=2014s) This is a god tier explanation of how HTTPS works and why we need certificates

- [TCP Handshake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F27PLin3TV0) This video for me personally does a really good explantation on what happens during the three-way handshake and it also goes into the Wireshark pcap at the end to see it in action. 

- A guide on [SSRF](https://www.intigriti.com/researchers/blog/hacking-tools/ssrf-a-complete-guide-to-exploiting-advanced-ssrf-vulnerabilities#5-exploiting-second-order-ssrfs)

## Challenges

These labs are technically resources too but these are definitely the challenges you want to do to enforce that understanding of the web 

- [PenTester Lab](https://pentesterlab.com/) Learn by exploiting real-world CVEs and analyzing vulnerabilities at the code level.

- PortSwigger Academy

- OWASP Juice Shop

- Some THM Web based free rooms that I could add

- [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/practice) I practiced a ton of Web Exp here but there's other categories as well!

## Tools

- SQLMap for SQL Injections

- Gobuster etc

- API stuff

- Postman stuff here


- [JWT Decode](https://jwt.io/) Paste a JWT below that you'd like to decode, validate, and verify.

- [JS Obfuscator](https://codebeautify.org/javascript-obfuscator)

- [JS Deobfuscator](https://obf-io.deobfuscate.io/)

- [HTTP Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com/) Scans for missing security headers by Snyk

- [XSS Hunter Express](https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/xsshunter-express) A tool to find XSS vulns
- [DNS Dumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/) DNSDumpster.com is a FREE domain research tool that can discover hosts related to a domain. Finding visible hosts from the attackers perspective is an important part of the security assessment process.

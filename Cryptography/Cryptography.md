# Cryptography

### What is Cryptography?
- Cryptography is the process of obscuring communications so only those with authorization have access.
- The process of obscuring those communications is known as encryption and the person on the other side of your communication must use decryption to access the information.
- There are 4 main principles of Cryptography:
    1. Confidentiality: Encrypted data may only be accessed by the intended party(s).
    2. Integrity: Encrypted data cannot be modified before it is recieved by the intended party(s) without alterations being detected.
    3. Non-Repudiation: The sender of the encrypted data cannot deny they sent it.
    4. Authentication: The party being sent the encrypted data is who they say they are.
- This [section](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/cryptography) of the IBM website is a great resource for learning more about Cryptography and is what I used as a framework for this section of the Github.

 ### Applications of Cryptography
 - Anything you do online that involves an exchange of sensitive information should involve some sort of Cryptography.
 - The passwords you use are often verified through a two-factor authenticator (such as DUO for Auburn University).
 - End-to-End Encryption is often used for private messaging systems to ensure only invited parties may read your messages.
 - Cryptocurrencies such a Bitcoin and Etherium use heavy layers of encryption to ensure confidentiality for their users.
 - These are just a few select examples of the power of a good encryption algorithm.

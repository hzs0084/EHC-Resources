Gemini believes that the answer is GEOTAGS

The correct answer is GEOTAGS.

The common factor in all four images, and the key to solving "Anomaly 38 - Guiding the Way," is that they all contain hidden GPS coordinates within their metadata, a process known as geotagging.

While a deeper analysis of the file attributes (like the 

com.apple.lastuseddate#PS which indicates the files were opened ) reveals access history, the question asks for something "all four images have in common" that "deeper analysis will reveal," leading to the content or embedded data of the images themselves.


The common method for hiding location data in images is via 

EXIF metadata (a type of metadata), which often includes 


Geographical Coordinates and location data (if geotagging was enabled). The presence of location data in media files is a known area of forensic analysis.

In the context of this specific puzzle, all four images contain GEOTAGS that, when extracted and mapped, reveal a secret location or pattern.


For the record, I don't think that's true but that's all I got from it

but looking at the exif gave some GPS Coordinates


image1.jpg → 43.6560, −70.0369 → Halfway Rock Light (Casco Bay, ME)

image2.jpg → 41.1534, −71.5521 → Block Island Southeast Light (RI)

image3.jpg → 37.1829, −122.3928 → Pigeon Point Light (CA)

image4.jpg → 45.8372, −84.6168 → Round Island area light near Mackinac (MI)

each lands on a lighthouse. some clue here?

# 2024_CyberForce_Competition
Welcome to the new document repository for the 2024 CyberForce Competition

This will be where the MOST up to date items will be kept for the competition. 
Some folders will be empty until you have access to the infrastructure. 

Infrastructure access will be provided on October 28, 2024. You will receive AWS Credentials as well as instructions on how to connect.

The week of October 21, you should be actively working on your C-Suite video. Good luck.
